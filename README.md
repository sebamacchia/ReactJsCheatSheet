## What is?

- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Was created and maintained by Facebook.

ReactJS makes no assumptions about your technology stack, so you can use ReactJS to:

Build a widget
Add a reusable component (header, footer, etc.)
Build the entire front-end experience (like Facebook)
Just to reiterate, you can incorporate ReactJS into different types of front-end tech stacks (AngularJS, Backbone, etc.) or you can choose to build entire applications out of ReactJS!
